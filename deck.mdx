<Header>
What Theme-UI is
</Header>


- Theme-UI is complete library built around creating themeable components. 
- It provides you a system for creating themes, and components that can be driven by them.
- It calls itself a mini-framework

---

<Header>
  What do themes look like? 
</Header>

Simple Javascript Objects.

```js
export default {
  colors: {
    text: '#000',
    background: '#fff',
    primary: '#33e',
  },
  ...
}
```

---

<Header>
  Where does the power come from?
</Header>

React Context +  
Using Tokens & SX Prop

Theme-UI uses the new context API to automagically feed your theme to your components, and third party components built with theme ui.

---

<FullScreenCode>

```js
export const theme = {
    colors: {
        primary: 'blue',
        secondary: 'red',
    }
}

export const Component = () => (
<div 
sx={{   width: "100px", 
        height: "100px", 
        backgroundColor: "primary"
    }} 
/>)


// layout.js
import { ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui'
import theme from './theme'
export default props => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{props.children}</ThemeProvider>
)
```


</FullScreenCode>

<Header>
    Theme Components
</Header>

Theme UI has an optional Package of Components. 

It includes stuff like Inputs, Buttons, Loading Spinners, and much more!

---

<Header>
    Styling Theme Components
</Header>

- Styling these components is very easy!   
- They are styled right on the theme object.
- These components can be used to build bigger, more complicated themeable components. 

---

<Header>
Components can define variants
</Header>

```jsx
<Button>Click</Button>
<Button variant="secondary">Click</Button>
```

<Button>Click</Button>
<Button variant="secondary">Click</Button>



---

### Defining Variants


```js
export default {
  buttons: {
    primary: {
      backgroundColor: "primary",
      padding: 4,
      margin: 4
    },
    secondary: {
      backgroundColor: "secondary",
      padding: 2,
      margin: 2
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

---

<Header>
Creating Components
</Header>

```jsx
const Header = ({ children }) => (
  <Flex
    sx={{
      alignItems: "center",
      justifyContent: "center",
      padding: 4,
      margin: 4,
      color: "secondary",
      border: theme => `1px solid ${theme.colors.primary}`
    }}
  >
    {children}
  </Flex>
);
```

---

<Header>
Break Points!
</Header>

You can define responsive styles just by using arrays!

```jsx
{
    fontSize: ['10px', '20px', '30px']
    color: ['green', 'red', 'blue']
}
```
You can also define your own breakpoints!


--- 

<Header>
    Even styles MDX!
</Header>

```js
  styles: {
    h1: {
      fontSize: 32,
      fontFamily: 'heading',
      fontWeight: 'heading',
      color: 'primary',
      mt: 4,
      mb: 2,
    },
  }
}
```
